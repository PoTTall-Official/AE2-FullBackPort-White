## Known issues
<details>
  <summary>Click to show spoiler</summary>
  
- Right side of the inserted cells in the ME drive is shifted 1 pixel to the right (Use AE2: UEL for fix);
- Dense smart cables will have a hole due to the finer texture of the displayed channels (Use AE2: UEL for fix);
- Base of the wooden handle rotates with it, although it should be stationary;
- ME wireless access point in the slot is displayed slightly out of position where it should be;
- Back texture of the P2P tunnels has strange blinking pixels (Everything is fine in the hand) - Flickering is fixed;
- Color applicator, which has a colored ball in it, breaks its model in the inventory, and becomes slightly larger in the hand;
- Color of the displayed elements on terminals is different from that on 1.21, but it still looks fine;
- Note: The back of the terminals uses its own texture (To avoid transparent pixels on the buses);
- Some terminals have a gray text input field in the search. This is a problem with the mod itself on version 1.12.2;
- Enter button is displayed very strangely in the interface of switching (using a quartz knife on a block from a mod);
- Storage bus interface breaks down when capacity cards are added;
- In the interface of the wireless template terminal, the terminal itself in the slot is reduced by 2 pixels in the AE2: UEL version.
